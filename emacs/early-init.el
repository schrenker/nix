;;; early-init.el --- Early Init File -*- lexical-binding: t; no-byte-compile: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Early init file. Here I disable built-in package manager in favor of elpaca, and set additional paths for native-comp dependencies.

;;; Code:

(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(setq elpaca-aot-native-compilation t)

;; Fix for ld: library not found for -lemutls_w libgccjit.so: error: error invoking gcc driver
(when (eq system-type 'darwin)
  (customize-set-variable 'native-comp-driver-options '("-Wl,-w"))
  (setq native-comp-async-jobs-number 8)
  (setenv "LIBRARY_PATH" "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib"))

(provide 'early-init)
;;; early-init.el ends here.
